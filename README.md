# Movies-recommender-system
This project is a movie recommender system that utilizes various libraries such as pandas, numpy, requests, streamlit, and sklearn. It employs a content-based recommendation approach, leveraging the TMDB dataset containing information on 5000 movies.



The website offers three options for obtaining movie recommendations. Firstly, users can input specific criteria such as revenue, vote count, popularity, and the desired number of movies. Secondly, users can enter the name of a movie, and similar movies will be recommended. Thirdly, users can access movie details including trailers and posters. Additionally, the website provides over 10 recommendations based on the entered movie.



By employing cutting-edge technologies and leveraging comprehensive movie data, this movie recommender system delivers personalized suggestions to enhance the movie-watching experience.
